# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
## Overview: 
  This project focuses on analyzing YouTube comments to gain insights into viewer engagement, sentiment, and trends. By leveraging various data analysis techniques and tools, we aim to extract meaningful patterns and insights from the comments section of YouTube videos.

## Features
Data Cleaning: Functions to clean and preprocess the raw data for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Implementation of sentiment analysis to gauge the overall sentiment of comments.
Keyword Extraction: Identifying key terms and phrases commonly used in the comments.
Visualization: Various plots and charts to visualize the data and the results of the analysis.

## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/advaypatil/youtube-statistics
  The dataset contains the top ten most relevant comments on 1.8k videos and said comments' sentiments and likes.

## Business Problem: 
  - Utilized the supervised learning techniques to understand the sentiments of a comment on YouTube videos.
  - Used Natural Language Preprocessing techniques and classification supervised learning models that are discrete (with an outcome of y=1 or 0) to analyze the data and find whether the sentiment of a comment on a YouTube video is positive or negative.

## Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language for data analysis and script development.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NLTK / SpaCy: For natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
Plotly / Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.
