# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
## Overview: 
  This project focuses on analyzing YouTube comments to gain insights into viewer engagement, sentiment, and trends. By leveraging various data analysis techniques and tools, we aim to extract meaningful patterns and insights from the comments section of YouTube videos.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Initial exploration of the data to find patterns, relationships, and key insights.
- Data Preparation & Cleaning: Functions to clean and preprocess the raw data for analysis.
- Data Representation & Vectorization: Transforming text data into numerical format for machine learning and advanced analysis.
- Sentiment Analysis: Implementation of sentiment analysis to gauge the overall sentiment of comments.
- Visualization: Various plots and charts to visualize the data and the results of the analysis.

## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/advaypatil/youtube-statistics
  The dataset contains the top ten most relevant comments on 1.8k videos and said comments' sentiments and likes.

## Business Problem: 
  - Utilized the supervised learning techniques to understand the sentiments of a comment on YouTube videos.
  - Used Natural Language Preprocessing techniques and classification supervised learning models that are discrete (with an outcome of y=1 or 0) to analyze the data and find whether the sentiment of a comment on a YouTube video is positive or negative.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language for data analysis and script development.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NLTK / SpaCy: For natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
- Plotly / Matplotlib / Seaborn / Word Cloud: For data visualization.
